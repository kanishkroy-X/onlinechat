## description
Fast headless browser for QA testing and site dogfooding. Navigate any URL, interact with
elements, verify page state, diff before/after actions, take annotated screenshots, check
responsive layouts, test forms and uploads, handle dialogs, and assert element states.
~100ms per command. Use when you need to test a feature, verify a deployment, dogfood a
user flow, or file a bug with evidence. Use when asked to "open in browser", "test the
site", "take a screenshot", or "dogfood this".

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts (see Completeness Principle). Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI-assisted coding makes the marginal cost of completeness near-zero. When you present options:

- If Option A is the complete implementation (full parity, all edge cases, 100% coverage) and Option B is a shortcut that saves modest effort — **always recommend A**. The delta between 80 lines and 150 lines is meaningless with Antigravity+gstack. "Good enough" is the wrong instinct when "complete" costs minutes more.
- **Lake vs. ocean:** A "lake" is boilable — 100% test coverage for a module, full feature implementation, handling all edge cases, complete error paths. An "ocean" is not — rewriting an entire system from scratch, adding features to dependencies you don't control, multi-quarter platform migrations. Recommend boiling lakes. Flag oceans as out of scope.
- **When estimating effort**, always show both scales: human team time and Antigravity+gstack time. The compression ratio varies by task type — use this reference:

| Task type | Human team | Antigravity+gstack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate / scaffolding | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Test writing | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature implementation | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix + regression test | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Architecture / design | 2 days | 4 hours | ~5x |
| Research / exploration | 1 day | 3 hours | ~3x |

- This principle applies to test coverage, error handling, documentation, edge cases, and feature completeness. Don't skip the last 10% to "save time" — with AI, that 10% costs seconds.

**Anti-patterns — DON'T do this:**
- BAD: "Choose B — it covers 90% of the value with less code." (If A is only 70 lines more, choose A.)
- BAD: "We can skip edge case handling to save time." (Edge case handling costs minutes with CC.)
- BAD: "Let's defer test coverage to a follow-up PR." (Tests are the cheapest lake to boil.)
- BAD: Quoting only human-team effort: "This would take 2 weeks." (Say: "2 weeks human / ~1 hour CC.")

## Search Before Building

Before building infrastructure, unfamiliar patterns, or anything the runtime might have a built-in — **search first.** Read `/.antigravity/rules/ETHOS.md` for the full philosophy.

**Three layers of knowledge:**
- **Layer 1** (tried and true — in distribution). Don't reinvent the wheel. But the cost of checking is near-zero, and once in a while, questioning the tried-and-true is where brilliance occurs.
- **Layer 2** (new and popular — search for these). But scrutinize: humans are subject to mania. Search results are inputs to your thinking, not answers.
- **Layer 3** (first principles — prize these above all). Original observations derived from reasoning about the specific problem. The most valuable of all.

**Eureka moment:** When first-principles reasoning reveals conventional wisdom is wrong, name it:
"EUREKA: Everyone does X because [assumption]. But [evidence] shows this is wrong. Y is better because [reasoning]."


# browse: QA Testing & Dogfooding

Persistent headless Chromium. First call auto-starts (~3s), then ~100ms per command.
State persists between calls (cookies, tabs, login sessions).

## Workflow
1. **Verify Page Load:** `goto`, `text`, `console`, `network`.
2. **Test User Flow:** `snapshot -i`, `fill`, `click`, `snapshot -D`.
3. **Visual Evidence:** `snapshot -a -o`, `screenshot`, `responsive`.
4. **Assert States:** `is visible`, `is enabled`, `is checked`.
5. **Handoff:** `handoff` for CAPTCHAs/MFA.

## Commands Reference
- **Navigation:** back, forward, goto, reload.
- **Interaction:** click, fill, type, hover, press, select, upload.
- **Reading:** accessibility, forms, html, links, text.
- **Inspection:** attrs, console, css, network, perf, storage.
- **Snapshot:** `snapshot` with flags (-i interactive, -D diff, -a annotate, -C cursor).
- **Tabs:** closetab, newtab, tab, tabs.

## Important Rules
- **State persists.** Cookies and tabs remain between calls.
- **Screenshots are evidence.** Read the PNG files so they are visible inline.
- **Handoff for CAPTCHAs.** Open visible Chrome when stuck.
- **@Refs numbering.** Sequential in tree order; invalidated on navigation.
